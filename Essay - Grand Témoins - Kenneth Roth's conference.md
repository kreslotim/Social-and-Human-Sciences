# Grand Témoin - Kenneth Roth's conference

### Introduction

Today, the most relevant subject for controversy is the Russo-Ukrainian War.
Mr. Kenneth Roth's eloquent speech, which was held at EPFL on 1st March 2022, emphasized the pulling events in Ukraine, suggesting that autocracy is the cause of all wars and national conflicts.
Stemming out from this conference, we will answer the following question:

**"Which idea put forward at Kenneth Roth's conference stimulated you the most, and why?"**

Surely, freedom of speech and human rights is a necessary condition for a progressive state, but in certain cases not sufficient. Indeed, a strong power crystallized from a democratic process in a large country is also an essential component. 

Quote from Roth's talk : "Autocracy rises, democracy declines. The autocrats just serve themselves - this is why we have a pandemic."
Of course, when a head of government takes advantage of his power for personal reasons, it can’t be good for anything. However, building a great house requires the architect to design the entire project with his own hands. Just as writing a legendary novel, such as Lev Tolstoy's "War and Peace", couldn't be accomplished if the author changed multiple times. 
A strong power concentrated in the hands of one person in the assumption that it is supported by a democratic process, might be the only solution for large states, where direct democracy, such as referendums in Switzerland, are not technically possible. Indeed, blaming anyone for what is happening on governmental level is not reasonable, especially in the heat of action. Political disagreements arise from apparent diplomat's ineptitude to compromise on a unique solution.

Therefore, from my opinion, we should learn to reach an agreement, instead of arguing each other's point of view. Being in favor of a cease-fire, and globally being in favor of peace, should not provoke one's to take unjustified political position based on emotions instead of cold-mind and reliable information. 
The real peace can be reached, not when everyone thinks the same about the government form or the president's decisions, etc... but when people who think differently manage to negotiate. 

Now, for obvious reasons, it’s hard to separate one from the other... When interlocutors succumb to emotions, it gets hard to evaluate each other's position adequately. Each of us has a right to think the way he thinks, to look at politicians the way he looks - and still remain in favor to stop people from killing each other. 

To conclude, seek for peace in a society with just one particular form of democracy, denying any other perspective doesn't seem to contribute to global peace. On the other hand, making the effort to understand a stranger's standpoint turns out to be the only way to contribute to harmonious existence. It is important to remember that when we talk to each other, look for what we have in common, not what makes us different.
