**Distributed Trust - Bitcoin and Blockchain**

**Introduction** 
A few weeks ago, Professor James Larus introduced us to blockchain technology, at the lectures, explaining basic principles of its architecture, what are the benefits as well as several disadvantages of this disruptive innovation. 
Stemming out from this lecture, we will discuss the following question: 

**"Can digital mechanisms such as blockchain create real trust between people ?"** 
A few years ago, on the threshold of this revolutionary technology, the main purpose behind was genuinely to provide every user a way to securely exchange and store digital information without needing to trust a third party to look after the data. 

Indeed, because blockchain relies on cryptographic rules and quite complex mathematical operations, counterfeiting is practically impossible, and thus the degree of confidence in such a powerful computational system greatly arises, which makes it very desirable not only for the IT or finance industry but, in general, for anyone who benefits from making encrypted money exchange.

Yet, such an increase in trustworthiness eventually relies on the governance of the underlying blockchain-based network, which requires trusting those who truly controls this mechanism. The problem is that no one does. And this is the other side of the coin. 

Certainly, due to its decentralized structure, we may highlight a few benefits, such as complete transparency of the transaction histories. Thanks to consensus algorithms ensuring replication across a network of computer systems, the shared ledger's content is entirely open-source. 
But on the other hand, because this financial network is distributed all over the globe, it goes beyond the control of the regency and banks, resulting that no one owns the network, and thus we encounter numerous global issues, such as money-laundering, or withdrawal of foreign exchange transactions from under the control of the government. Because of the ease in converting money into cryptocurrency through crypto platforms, they may be used to convert cash from illegal activities into cryptocurrencies, making underlying assets more difficult to trace. Consequently, the trust in these latter collapses, from the point of view of the clearing authorities, tax bodies and auditors. 

This leads us to a paradox - While the blockchain was initially designed and developed to provide for secure platform leaving no room for fraud, the global society trust to cryptocurrencies failed. Now we should ask ourselves, what do we have influence over ? We have seen that blockchain's architecture is self-sufficient and works regardless of people's intervention. 

Therefore, from my opinion, we should pay attention to relations between ourselves. Trust is established between people who act in mutual interests, instead of their own. Hence, we should maintain a chain of creative and constructive deeds aimed at the common well-being, and the improvement of the world. 

Quote from Douglas Rushkoff's talk at TED conference : "Instead of trying to earn enough money to isolate ourselves from the world we're creating, why don't we spend that time and energy making the world a place that we don't feel the need to escape from ?" 

To conclude, digital technologies such as blockchain, seem to provide a substitute for "trust" between people, but certainly does not create it. This solution suits in our society, because our fidelity is based on smart code and applied sciences.
But as for trusting each other, it is our responsibility to choose honestly the purpose of our trades.
